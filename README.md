## Setup Instructions

(mainly notes for myself, unless someone else wants to replicate this exact setup)

- These dotfiles are stored in a bare git repository. Follow [these instructions](https://archive.ph/FBqXd) to set it up.
- Run `bin/dotfile-symlinks.sh` to create symlinks
- To set up KDE with i3, follow [these instructions](https://archive.ph/YqPKX#Use_a_different_window_manager). When installing from EndeavourOS ISO, pick KDE first, then install `i3-gaps` later.
