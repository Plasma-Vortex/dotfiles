## Setup Instructions

(mainly notes for myself, unless someone else wants to replicate this exact setup)

- These dotfiles are stored in a bare git repository. Follow [these instructions](https://archive.ph/FBqXd) to set it up.
- To set up KDE with i3, follow [these instructions](https://archive.ph/YqPKX#Use_a_different_window_manager). When installing from EndeavourOS ISO, pick KDE first, then install `i3-gaps` later.
- For vim, use `setxkbmap -option caps:escape` to map Caps Lock to Escape. Use `setxkbmap -option` to undo the mapping.
- KDE Global Theme: [Sweet KDE](https://store.kde.org/p/1294174/)
